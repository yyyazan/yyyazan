                DreamWorks' latest movie follows the story of a robot stranded on an island teeming with wildlife. 
                Roz - short for ROZZUM Unit 7134 - awakens ashore an island with no memory of how she got there. 
                Director 
                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761498/">Chris Sanders</a> 
                (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275847/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_t_1">Lilo & Stitch</a>,  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892769/?ref_=nm_flmg_knf_t_2">How To Train Your Dragon</a>) leaves no time for a dull moment; 
                the movie delivers breathtaking landscapes and stunning visuals shot after shot. Our protagonist (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2143282/?ref_=tt_cl_t_1">Lupita Nyong'o</a>) 
                also doesn't wait around, as her programming drives her to assist others. Dialog is sharp and witty,
                 and resonates with viewers of all ages.

        Voicework is more than enjoyable, with a cast including 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000434/?ref_=tt_cl_t_8">Mark Hamill</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5598573/?ref_=tt_cl_t_3">Kit Connor</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050959/?ref_=tt_cl_t_2">Pedro Pascal</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3513533/?ref_=tt_cl_t_5">Stephanie Hsu</a>, 
        and 
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000609/?ref_=tt_cl_t_7">Ving Rhames</a>, just to mention a few.
             Nyong'o brings a wealth of warmth to the robot protagonist, making her that more relatable and lovable while maintaining 
             her robotic demeanor. The robot assistant quite literally stumbles upon a new task: raising an orphaned gosling, after 
             she accidentally tumbled and crushed its nest.

            As a family-oriented film, "The Wild Robot" has familiar themes of community and the selflessness of parenthood.
             It stands out by telling the story from the perspective of a robot who is at times as clueless as some of the younger kids watching,
              making it equally entertaining for adults to observe Roz navigating these new experiences. 
        </p>

            Despite being a kids' movie, the film's messages resonate strongly with a wide audience. Sander's direction walks a thin line 
            between sending a positive message without shying away from showing the harsh realities of the circle of life. 
            Climate change is presented as an existential threat; a harsh winter storm blankets the island in snow and wreaks havok on its 
            fauna. As the narrative unfolds, it highlights rising sea levels submerging landscapes, severely arid deserts, and 
            crops cultivated within tightly controlled indoor environments.

                While its themes talk about very real issues, the film presents those themes with an impressionistic approach. Rather 
                than accurately depicting natural environments, the landscape always puts emotion first and enriches our protagonists'
                 journey. In every single scene, the painterly skies serve as a reflection of each scene's emotional tone: overcast 
                 skies cast a somber gray hue as Roz struggles to understand how she became stranded. Vibrant sun rays pierce through 
                 dense foliage as Roz joyfully explores her surroundings with her new friends. Sanders captures everything from sprawling 
                 forests to<a href="https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/node/197502"> Monet-esque </a> foliage, right down to the intricate details of a single blade of grass. This remarkable level of 
                 precision and fluidity enhances the film’s visual storytelling, demonstrating how animation can achieve a depth and 
                 artistry that live-action often cannot replicate.
        
    
            </p>
    
            <p>         The film encourages the audience to consider the scale of life, tying into its overarching themes of community and 
                collaboration. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/foreshortening">Foreshortening</a> is expertly used —a technique that creates an illusion of depth by depicting objects 
                receding into the background—to express the scale of life, keeping in sharp focus a dizzying level of intricate detail 
                that would take multiple viewings to fully appreciate. It is impressive how far the artists have managed to push the
                 bounderies of computer graphics.

               The movie also speaks to a very important subject; childrens entertainment does not have to be catered only to children. 
                Quite the opposite, it is vital that kids are exposed to high-quality content that respects their intelligence.
                This is especially crucial in an age where the quality of children’s TV shows and movies has declined drastically. The widespread success of low-budget youtube videos leaves children growing up never 
                reminiscing about memorable shows like generations before did. 

            </p>

            <p>
                The Wild Robot serves as a cautionary tale, warning of a future where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_(robot)">automation takes over all labor</a>,
                 leaving humanity in a less-than-ideal state—both environmentally and creatively.

                As part of cost cutting measures, <a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/studios/dreamworks-shifting-away-from-in-house-production-in-los-
                angeles-sony-imageworks-is-new-production-partner-233466.html">DreamWorks will no longer produce its films fully in-house.</a>
                Instead, the studio plans to rely on third-party companies for animation. Amidst these layoffs, the film's success—both 
            critically and at the box office—will hopefully show DreamWorks that producing high-quality animation is 
            still worthwhile.

        "The Wild Robot" stands as visual poetry. beautifully illustrating the journey of discovering one's purpose. The film masterfully displays
         themes of responsibility, self-sacrifice, and teamwork. "The Wild Robot" is not only one of the best films of the year but also a no-doubt 
         classic.
